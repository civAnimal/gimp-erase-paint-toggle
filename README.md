## GIMP Erase-Paint Toggle

This GIMP plugin allows you to quickly switch between __Paint__ and __Erase__ modes during painting. Most digital-painting softwares come preloaded with this feature. Users from other softwares have long missed this feature in GIMP. Well, not any more.

As you are painting, simply press the `E` key to activate the _Erase-Mode_ and remove any unwanted stuff easily. Once you're done erasing, just press the `E` key again to reactivate the _Paint-Mode_ and resume adding paint strokes. This way you could conveniently toggle between _Paint/Erase_ modes as and when you require with the simple press of a key.
